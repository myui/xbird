{{{
I've found it easier to simply put XQuery directly on the web. 
What you do is put .xqy files on the server that are XQuery scripts to produce XHTML pages. 
It works like a CGI or JSP, but instead of running Perl or Java, the server runs XQuery. 
XQuery has native support for XML and XHTML, so writing XQuery pages is an amazingly easy way to put back-end data on the web. 
There is no impedance mismatch. In just 250 lines I wrote a web-based RSS reader with cross-feed search.
